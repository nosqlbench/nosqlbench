# Getting Support

In general, our goals with NoSQLBench are to make the help systems and examples wrap around the users like
a suit of armor, so that they feel capable of doing most things without having to ask for help. Please
keep this in mind when looking for personal support form our community, and help us find those places
where the docs are lacking. Maybe you can help us by adding some missing docs!
     
## NoSQLBench Slack

There is a new [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/nosqlbench/shared_invite/zt-cu9f2jpe-XiHN3SsUDcjkVgxaURFuaw) for NoSQLBench.
Please join it if you are a new or existing NoSQLBench user and help us get it going!

## General Feedback

These guidelines are mirrored at the [Submitting Feedback](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/wiki/Submitting-Feedback)
wiki page at the nosqlbench project site, which is also where any `[Submit Feedback]` links should will take you.

## Bug Fixes

If you think you have found a bug, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug).
nosqlbench is actively used within DataStax, and verified bugs will get attention as resources permit. Bugs reports which are
more detailed, or bug reports which include steps to reproduce will get attention first.

If you would like to see something in nosqlbench that is not there yet,
