# Driver Types

Each nosqlbench scenario is comprised of one or more activities of a specific type. The types of activities available
are provided by the version of nosqlbench.

You can see this list at any time by running the command:

    nb --list-driver-types

Each one comes with its own built-in documentation. It can be accessed with this command:

    nb help <driver>

This section contains the per-driver documentation that you get when you run the above command. These driver docs are
auto-populated when NoSQLBench is built, so they are exactly the same as you will see with the above command, only
rendered in HTML.

There may be additional documentation related to a given driver. To see the list of help topics, you
can run this command:

    nb help topics

The help for any topic can be read this way:

    nb help <topic>
