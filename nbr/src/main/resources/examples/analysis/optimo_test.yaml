  # distinctions: commands are stateless outside of their invocations. commands may have ephemeral state while they are running.
  # Any last state effects from a command are manifested as changes to components, like changes to an activity, threads, etc.
  # contexts are state. Parameters go with contexts to qualify how a command behaves.
