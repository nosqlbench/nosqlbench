  This is a set of example for how to create or use
  CharBuffers in various ways.
  Two function types work together to offer flexibility in how you build
  text images for sampling.



bindings:

  # This helps us see the correspondence between input values and the results
  # on the functions below.
  cycle: Identity()

  # CharBufImage(...) creates arbitrarily large characer buffers in memory
  # to sample random extracts from. This function comes in a few forms:

  # With default image function and fixed length output. This is only
  # useful when you just want a static text image, either to init another
  # function with, or for specialized testing scenarios. This uses characters
  # a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and space only.
  cb_fixed: CharBufImage(100) # imgsize

  # Another static image form as above, but this one you can configure
  # with a source function which provides the initial data. Any
  # object type is allowed, as the toString() method is used to iteratively
  # fill the initial buffer until it is full according to the imgsize
  # This mode still only provides a single possible result.
  #
  # Create a CharBuffer of 100 characters from the names of numbers
  cb_composed_fixed: CharBufImage(NumberNameToString(),100) # srcfunc, imgsize

  # Alternately, you can simply provide a set of printable characters and
  # ranges from US-ASCII instead of providing a full function. In this mode,
  # characters are selected from the provided set for the initial fill.
  # This mode still only provides a single possible result.
  #
  # Create a CharBuffer of 100 characters consisting of hexadecimal digits.
  cb_charsets_fixed: CharBufImage('0-9A-F',100) # srcchars, imgsize

  # All CharBufImage forms with three or more parameters will return
  # useful and distinct samples per input value. In these forms, the third
  # parameter is either a number specifying the extracted value size,
  # or a function which dynamically selects the size.

  # Sample from a CharBuffer of 1000 characters, 10 characters at a time
  cb_samples_10chars: CharBufImage('A-Za-z0-9 _|/',1000,10) # srcchars, imgsize, samplesize

  # Sample from a text image of 1000 characters, 10 characters at a time,
  # but with the image built from long values in string form.
  # This example shows coercing the parser to limit to valid functions,
  # since virtdata isn't yet smart enough to do this automatically.
  # (CharBufImage shares its input long with any inner functions)
  #
  # Sample from a CharBuffer of 1000 characters, 10 at a time, from the
  # string representation of long values.
  cb_samples_composed_10chars: CharBufImage(long->ToString(),1000,10)

  # Sample from a text image of 1000 characters, with an extracted length
  # of between 13 and 17 characters, inclusive.
  cb_samples_varychars: CharBufImage('A-Za-z0-9 _|/',1000,HashRange(13,17))

  # Sample from a text image of 1000 characters, with an extracted length
  # of between 13 and 17 characters, inclusive, but with the images built
  # from long values in string form.
  cb_samples_composed_varychars: CharBufImage(long->ToString(),1000,HashRange(13,17))

  # Sometimes you want to modify a test by changing the dataset used.
  # By changing the seed from the default of 0L, you can force the
  # initial image to be varied. Each seed should be thought of as a bank
  # selector. This can be useful to ensure that data is different
  # across similar fields in a test, for example.
  cb_samples_with_seed: CharBufImage('01 ',100,3,2L)
