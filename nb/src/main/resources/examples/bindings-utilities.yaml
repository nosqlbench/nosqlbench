description: examples of bindings that help you design data sets

scenarios:
  default:
    stdout: run driver===stdout format=readout

bindings:

# The Identity() function is just a handy place holder to let you get the
# cycle number unchanged.

  n: Identity();

# NumberNameToString produces a name for a number all the way up to
# Long.MAX_VALUE, and all negative values except for LONG.MIN_VALUE.
# It is quite useful for sketching data and relationships where you
# need a text field in your data. For fluffy text, use a higher
# cycle range.

  name: NumberNameToString();

# The TypeOf() function tells you the java class of its input

  typeof: TypeOf();

# The Show() function provides a snapshot of what is in the thread-local
# variable map as a String

  show: Show();
