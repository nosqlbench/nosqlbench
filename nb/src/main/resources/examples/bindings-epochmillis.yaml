description: examples of bindings that produce long values as epoch millis

scenarios:
  default: run type===stdout format=readout

# If you want to control the output, uncomment and edit the statement template below
# and modify the named anchors to suit your output requirements.

#statements:
#  example1: "{epochMillis}\n"

bindings:

  # All uncommented lines under this are indented, so they become named bindings below
  # the entry above

  # Normally, the value that you get with a cycle starts at 0.

 cycleNum: Identity();

# All uncommented lines under this are indented, so they become named bindings below
# the entry above

# You can offset the start of your millis to some formatted date.
# Notice, that in this case, the result is still in millis since the epoch

 randomMillisStartingFeb2018: StartingEpochMillis('2018-02-01 05:00:00');

# You can randomly offset the value by some amount as shown below.
# In this case, the AddHashRange(...) function is internally hashing
# the input value and down-sampling it to the range specified, and then
# adding the resulting value to the input. The range is selected as
# 0,2419200000 because that is how many milliseconds there are in February.

 randomMillisWithinFeb2018: AddHashRange(0,2419200000L); StartingEpochMillis('2018-02-01 05:00:00');
