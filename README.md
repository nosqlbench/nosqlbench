## What is NoSQLBench?

NoSQLBench is a serious performance testing tool for the NoSQL ecosystem. It brings together features and capabilities
that are not found in any other tool.

- You can run common testing workloads directly from the command line. You can start doing this within 5 minutes of
   reading this.
- You can generate virtual data sets of arbitrary size, with deterministic data and statistically shaped values.
- You can design custom workloads that emulate your application, contained in a single file, based on statement
   templates - no IDE or coding required.
- When needed, you can open the access panels and rewire the runtime behavior of NoSQLBench to do advanced testing,
   including a full scripting environment with Javascript.

The core machinery of NoSQLBench has been built with attention to detail. It has been battle tested within DataStax as a
way to help users validate their data models, baseline system performance, and qualify system designs for scale.

In short, NoSQLBench wishes to be a programmable power tool for performance testing. However, it is somewhat generic. It
doesn't know directly about a particular type of system, or protocol. It simply provides a suitable machine harness in
which to put your drivers and testing logic. If you know how to build a client for a particular kind of system, it will
let you load it like a plugin and control it dynamically.

Initially, NoSQLBench comes with support for CQL, but we would like to see this expanded with contributions from others.

## Origins

The code in this project comes from multiple sources. The procedural data generation capability was known before as
'Virtual Data Set'. The core runtime and scripting harness was from the 'EngineBlock' project. The CQL support was
previously used within DataStax. In March of 2020, DataStax and the project maintainers for these projects decided to
put everything into one OSS project in order to make contributions and sharing easier for everyone. Thus, the new
project name and structure was launched as nosqlbench.io. NoSQLBench is an independent project that is sponsored by
DataStax.

We offer NoSQLBench as a new way of thinking about testing systems. It is not limited to testing only one type of
system. It is our wish to build a community of users and practice around this project so that everyone in the NoSQL
ecosystem can benefit from common concepts and understanding and reliable patterns of use.

## Getting Support

In general, our goals with NoSQLBench are to make the help systems and examples wrap around the users like a suit of
armor, so that they feel capable of doing most things autonomously. Please keep this in mind when looking for personal
support form our community, and help us find those places where the docs are lacking. Maybe you can help us by adding
some missing docs!

### NoSQLBench Discord Server

We have a discord server. This is where users and developers can discuss
anything about NoSQLBench and support each other.
Please [join us](https://discord.gg/dBHRakusMN) there if you are a new
user of NoSQLBench!

## Contributing

We are actively looking for contributors to help make NoSQLBench better. This is an ambitious project that is just
finding its stride. If you want to be part of the next chapter in NoSQLBench development please look at
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for ideas, and jump in where you feel comfortable.

All contributors are expected to abide by the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## License

All of the code in this repository is licensed under the APL version 2. If you contribute to this project, then you must
agree to license all of your constributions under this license.

## System Compatibility

This is a Linux targeted tool, as most cloud/nosql testing is done on Linux instances. Some support for other systems is
available, but more work is needed to support them fully. Here is what is supported for each:

1. on Linux, all features are supported, for both `nb5.jar` as well as the appimage binary `nb`
2. on Mac, all features are supported, with `nb5.jar`.
3. on Windows, all features are supported, with `nb5.jar`.
