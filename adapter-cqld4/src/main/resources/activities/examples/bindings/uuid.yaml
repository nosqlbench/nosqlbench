# You can run this file with this command line to see the values printed to stdout:
# ./ebdse run driver=stdout yaml=bindings/uuid.yaml cycles=10

# This file demonstrates different types of timestamp recipes
# that you can use with virtdata. (The bindings used in ebdse)

# If you want to control the output, uncomment and edit the statement template below
# and modify the named anchors to suit your output requirements.

#statements:
#  example1: "{fullname}\n"

bindings:

# All uncommented lines under this are indented, so they become named bindings below
# the entry above

# Normally, the value that you get with a cycle starts at 0.

 cycleNum: Identity();

# here we convert the cycle number to a UUID by casting.
 id: Identity(); ToHashedUUID()

##    Station ID (100 unique UUID values, can override stations on the command-line)
 station_id: Mod(<<stations:100>>); ToHashedUUID()
