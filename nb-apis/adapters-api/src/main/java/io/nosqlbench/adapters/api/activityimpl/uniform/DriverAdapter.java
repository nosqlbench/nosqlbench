/// The DriverAdapter interface is the top level API for implementing operations of any kind in
/// NoSQLBench. It defines the related APIs needed to fully realize an adapter at runtime. A
/// driver adapter can map op templates from YAML form to a fully executable form in native Java
/// code, and then execute those native operations just as an application might do directly
/// with a native driver. It can also do trivial operations, like simply calling
/// `System.out.println(...)`. What a particular driver adapter does is open-ended, but this
/// usually means wrapping a native driver when supporting specific protocols.
///
/// Every DriverAdapter has a simple name, as indicated on it's [Service] annotation. When you
/// specify an adapter by name, you are choosing both the available operations, and the rules
/// for converting a YAML op template into those operations. This is a two-step process: Mapping
/// user intentions, and generating executable operations, called op mapping and op dispensing,
/// respectively. Each adapter provides implementations for both of these phases for all the op
/// types is supports. When used together, they power _op synthesis_ -- efficient and
/// deterministic construction of runtime operations using procedural generation methods.
///
/// An overview of all the key elements of the adapter API is given here. Understanding this
/// section means you know how the core op generator logic of NoSQLBench works.
///
/// Generally speaking, a driver adapter is responsible for
///  - Implementing a type of adapter-specific [Space] to hold related state.
///    - The type of this is specified as generic parameter [SPACETYPE] on [DriverAdapter].
///    - This is the primary state holder for any thing an application would typically need in order
/// to use a
///    (specific) native driver. Space instances are analogous to application instances, although
///    they only hold the essential state needed to enable native driver usage. By default, an
///    adapter only provides a single space, but users can override this to achieve higher native
///    driver concurrency for some specialized types of testing.
///  - In [DriverAdapter#getSpaceInitializer(NBConfiguration)], defining a factory method for
///    constructing an instance of the space when needed.
///    - The [NBConfiguration] is provided to configure app or driver settings as specified by
///      the user in activity parameters.
///  - in [OpMapper#apply(NBComponent, ParsedOp, LongFunction)], recognizing the op template
///    that is documented for it and constructing a matching [OpDispenser]`<`[OPTYPE]`>`.
///    - The [NBComponent] is part of the runtime component tree, and can be used to attach
///      user-visible component and naming structure as needed. The component tree supports
///      runtime event propogation, and automatic dimensional-labeling within the NoSQLBench
///      runtime. It also provides services for creating context-anchored metrics instruments,
///      configuration linting, and so on.
///    - The [ParsedOp] is a fully normalized view of an [OpTemplate], adhering to all the rules
///      of the _Uniform_ [workload_definition]. The parsed op API provides methods to assist in
///      constructing the lambdas which are the backbone of op synthesis. Lambdas constructed in
///      this way are highly efficient in modern JVM implementations, and serve effectively as
///      defered compilation in NoSQLBench.
///    - The [LongFunction]`<`[SPACETYPE]`>` provides functional access to the space needed for an
///      operation. It is a long function, since the space instance may be specific for each
///      (long) cycle value
///  - in [OpDispenser#apply(long)]), creating an executable operation in the form of a [CycleOp].
///    - Op dispenser logic should call a previously constructed lambda, having been built either
/// in
///      the body of [OpMapper#apply(NBComponent, ParsedOp, LongFunction)] or in the constructor of
///      [OpDispenser]. In either case, the op synthesis function is realized before the op
///      dispenser is fully constructed, ensuring that op generation is streamlined.
///    - The long value provided here is the cycle value, and is the primary _coordinate_ provided
///      to the op synthesis lambda. Any properties or features of the operation should be fully
///      determined, and a matching immutable op implementation should be returned.
///  - implement [CycleOp#apply(long)] for each unique type of operation which can be dispensed.
///    - CycleOps should be immutable, since they may be retried when necessary.
///      Subsequent calls should exactly the same thing for a given op instance.
///    - the long cycle value is provided here for special cases like error handling, logging,
///      or debugging, but should not be needed for normal op execution.
///
/// ---
///
/// At a high level, the following sequence is executed for every cycle in an activity:
/// ```
///[cycle value] -> op synthesis -> [executable op] -> op execution
///```
/// or, as a functional sketch, `opExecution(opFunction(cycle))`.  This is a simplified view of the
/// detailed steps, most of which are handled automatically by the nosqlbench runtime engine:
///
/// ```
/// cycle value
/// -> op template sequencing       # memoized
/// -> op template selection        # memoized
/// -> op template parsing          # memoized
/// -> op template normalization    # memoized
/// -> op type mapping              # memoized
/// -> op dispensing
/// -> op execution
///```
///
/// Notice that some stages are optimized via a form of memoization, for efficient execution.
///
/// ---
///
/// ### Variable Naming Conventions
///
/// Within the related [DriverAdapter] APIs, the following conventions are (more often) used, and will be
/// found everywhere:
/// - `namedF` describes a namedFunction variable. Functional patterns are used everywhere in these APIs.
/// - `namedC` describes a namedComponent variable. All key elements of the nosqlbench runtime are part of a
///   component tree.
/// - `pop` describes a [ParsedOp] instance.
///
/// ---
///
/// ### Generic Parameters
///
/// When a new driver adapter is defined with the generic parameters below, it becomes easy to build out a matching
/// [DriverAdapter] with any modern IDE by using the _implement interface ..._ and similar features.
///
/// @param OPTYPE
///     The type of [CycleOp] which will be used to wrap all operations for this driver adapter.
///     This allows you to add context or features common to all operations of this type. This can
///     be a simple
///     [marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern) interface,
///         or it can be something more concrete that captures common logic or state across all the
///     operations used for a given adapter. It is highly advised to _NOT_ leave it as simply
///     `CycleOp<?>`, since specific op implementations offer much better performance.
/// @param SPACETYPE
///     The type of context space used by this driver to hold cached instances of clients,
///     session, or other native driver state. This is the shared state which might be needed
///     during construction operations for an adapter. No other mechanism is provided nor intended
///     for holding adapter-specific state. You must store it in this type. This includes client
///     instances, codec mappings, or anything else that a single instance of an application would
///     need to effectively use a given native driver.
///

    /// ## Op Mapping
    ///
    /// An Op Mapper is a function which can look at a [ParsedOp] and create a matching
    /// [OpDispenser].
    /// An OpDispenser is a function that will produce a special type [OPTYPE] that this
    /// DriverAdapter implements.
    /// There may be many different ops supported by an adapter, thus there may be similarly many
    /// dispensers.
    ///
    /// Both [OpMapper] and [OpDispenser] are functions. The role of [OpMapper] is to map the op
    /// template provided
    /// by the user to an op implementation provided by the driver adapter, and then to create a
    /// suitable function for
    /// creating that type of operations, known as the [OpDispenser].
    ///
    /// These roles are split for a very good reason: Mapping what the user wants to do with an op
    /// template
    /// is resource intensive, and should be as pre-baked as possible. This phase is the _op
    /// mapping_ phase.
    /// It is essential that the mapping logic be very clear and maintainable. Performance is not as
    /// important
    /// at this phase, because all of the mapping logic is run during initialization of an
    /// activity.

    /// efficient as possible.
