/**
 * <P>The mappings between logging levels for conditions and the advisory
 * levels should be consistent, so they will be described here to start.</P>
 *
 * <P>These are the levels which conditions should use:</P>
 * <OL>
 *     <LI>Level.ERROR (internal to conditions, cause immediate exceptions)</LI>
 *     <LI>Level.WARN (conditions which should inform the user about a likely issue)</LI>
 *     <LI>Level.INFO (conditions which may inform the user about a possible issue)</LI>
 * </OL>
 *
 * <P>This means that the following three behaviors are possible:
 * <OL>
 *     <LI>{@link io.nosqlbench.nb.api.advisor.NBAdvisorLevel#none} - Only ERROR level results throw exceptions, no
 *     results are presented.</LI>
 *     <LI>{@link io.nosqlbench.nb.api.advisor.NBAdvisorLevel#validate} - Only ERROR level results throw exceptions,
 *     all results are presented. </LI>
 *     <LI>{@link io.nosqlbench.nb.api.advisor.NBAdvisorLevel#enforce} - ERROR and WARN levels throw exceptions.</LI>
 * </P>
