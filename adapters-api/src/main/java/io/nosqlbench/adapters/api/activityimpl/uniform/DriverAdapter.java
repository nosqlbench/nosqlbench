/**
 * <P>The DriverAdapter interface is expected to be the replacement
 * for ActivityTypes. This interface takes a simpler
 * approach. Specifically, all of the core logic which was being pasted into each
 * driver type is centralized, and only the necessary interfaces
 * needed for construction new operations and shared context are exposed.
 * This means all drivers can now benefit from cross-cutting enhancements
 * in the core implementation.
 * </P>
 *
 * @param <OPTYPE> The type of Runnable operation which will be used to wrap
 *            all operations for this driver adapter. This allows you to
 *            add context or features common to all operations of this
 *            type.
 * @param <SPACETYPE> The type of context space used by this driver to hold
 *            cached instances of clients, session, or other native driver
 *            esoterica. This is the shared state which might be needed
 *            during construction of R type operations, or even for individual
 *            operations.

     * <H2>Op Mapping</H2>
     * An Op Mapper is a function which can look at the parsed
     * fields in a {@link ParsedOp} and create an OpDispenser.
     * An OpDispenser is a function that will produce a special
     * type {@link OPTYPE} that this DriverAdapter implements as its
     * op implementation.</p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The function that is returned is responsible for creating another function.
     * This might seem counter-intuitive but it is very intentional because
     * of these design constraints:
     * <UL>
     * <LI>Mapping op semantics to a type of operation must be very clear
     * and flexible. Performance is not important at this layer because this is all done
     * during initialization time for an activity.</LI>
     * <LI>Synthesizing executable operations from a known type of operational template
     * must be done very efficiently. This part is done during activity execution, so
     * having the details of how you are going to create an op for execution already
     * sorted out is important.</LI>
     * </UL>
     *
     * To clarify the distinction between these two phases, the first is canonically
     * called <em>op mapping</em> in the documentation. The second is called
     * <em>op synthesis</em>.
     * </p>

     * Generally speaking, implementations of this method should interrogate the op fields
     * in the ParsedOp and return an OpDispenser that matches the user's intentions.
     * This can be based on something explicit, like the  value of a {@code type} field,
     * or it can be based on whether certain fields are present or not. Advanced implementations
     * might take into account which fields are provided as static values and which are
     * specified as bindings. In any case, the op mapping phase is meant to qualify and
     * pre-check that the fields provided are valid and specific for a given type of operation.
     * What happens within {@link OpDispenser} implementations (the second phase), however, should do
     * as little qualification of field values as possible, focusing simply on constructing
     * the type of operation for which they are designed.
