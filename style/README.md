The code style docs and settings for this project are here. This is exploratory
and an open topic for maintainers to build consensus on.

Initially, the spotless maven plugin was tested, but this was not satisfactory.
To get started, the format will likely be captured as what the IntelliJ code
formatter can support, with plugin selection biased towards what is mostly
compatible.

For experimentation with this, use the IntelliJ editor|code style|Java|import option
with the files in this directory.

Any changes agreed to by maintainers will be made to the style spec in this directory.
