For example, if you are running a system marginally\nbeyond its capacity, the tries for operations will go above 1 at the higher percentiles such as P99. If you increase the load even further, more retries\nwill be needed and less work will be completed, thus showing higher retries at even lower percentiles, like P95, for example.\n\nAs such, you can use the tries metric as an indicator of relative saturation.",
