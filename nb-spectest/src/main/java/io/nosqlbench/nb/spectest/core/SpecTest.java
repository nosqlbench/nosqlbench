/**
 * This is the entry point into a specification test. By default, all files
 * within the provided path are checked for the scanner patterns,
 * and all validators are run. This means:
 *
 * <OL>
 *     <LI>All provided paths which are markdown files will be scanned.</LI>
 *     <LI>All provided paths which are directories will be recursively scanned for contained markdown files.</LI>
 *     <LI>Every included markdown file will be scanned for matching element sequences.</LI>
 *     <LI>Every matching element sequence will be validated.</LI>
 * </OL>
 *
 * <p>The details of each of these steps should be documented in the specific classes which implement
 * the behavior. At a high level:
 *
 * Key concepts are:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>Specification Files - These are the markdown files and included sets of specification tuples.
 *     Specification tuples are sequences of content elements which are recognizable by a scanner
 *     as going together to form a multi-part specification and test.</LI>
 *     <LI>Scanners - A scanner is a pattern matcher specification, in the form of a set of predicate objects.
 *     These are tested against sequences of elements that are found within specification files. Each
 *     time a scanner matches a sequence of elements, a specification template is extracted and submitted
 *     to a set of validators.</LI>
 *     <LI>Specification Template - This is merely a set of content elements which represents a specific
 *     specification or example. When a specification template is found, it is extracted with some context
 *     metadata that makes it easy to identify and report (like the heading), as well as the content needed
 *     for a specification validator to confirm whether or not it passes a test for validity.</LI>
 *     <LI>Validators - A validator knows how to assert the validity of a specification template. It is
 *     essentially a set of test assertions against a specification template. There are default validators
 *     which do different types of validation based on the content type.</LI>
 * </UL>
 *
 * Effectively, all specifications are described prosaically within the markdown, while the actual specifications
 * which are meant to be validated are captured within fenced code sections. The type of fenced code section
 * determines how the inner content is interpreted and validated.
 *
 * </p>
