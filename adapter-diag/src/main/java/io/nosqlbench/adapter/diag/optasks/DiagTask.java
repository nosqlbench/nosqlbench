/**
 * The base type for building Diagnostic Op tasks, which are composed into
 * a diagnostic operation in order. This allows for a very flexible compositional
 * structure which can be extended as needed. The diag driver is meant to
 * be the core driver for the purposes of validating the NoSQLBench engine
 * and associated libraries and extensions.
 *
 * The tasks are retained as shared across threads by default. This means that if
 * you want to have per-thread logic or to do things which are not thread-safe,
 * you need to use ThreadLocal or some other pattern to do so.
 *
 * Tasks must provide a no-args constructor (or no constructor, which does the same).
 * Tasks must specify their configuration requirements via the {@link NBConfigurable}
 * interface.
 *
 * Tasks may be evented for updates from the activity params at runtime by implementing
 * the {@link NBReconfigurable} interface.
