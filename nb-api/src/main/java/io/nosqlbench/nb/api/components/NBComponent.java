/**
 * A Component is a functional element of the NoSQLBench runtime which is:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>Contract Oriented - Components are based on well-defined interfaces.</LI>
 *     <LI>Modular - Components are wired together by configuration.</LI>
 *     <LI>Configurable - Components have configurations which are well defined and type safe.</LI>
 *     <LI>User Facing - Components are top level constructs which users interact with.</LI>
 *     <LI>Hierarchic - Components fit together in a runtime hierarchy. Only the ROOT component is allowed to have no parents.</LI>
 *     <LI>Addressable - Each component has a set of metadata which allows it to be identified clearly under its parent.</LI>
 * </UL>
 *
 * This interface includes more aspects of above by extension going forward.
