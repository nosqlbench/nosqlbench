This section covers a sampling of what makes NoSQLBench unique. Many of these features simply could not be found in other testing systems when they were needed. Thus, NoSQLBench took form as we solved them one after another in the same tool space. The result is a powerful runtime and system of components and concepts which can be adapted to a variety of testing needs.<h2 id=virtual-data-set>Virtual Data Set</h2><p>The <em>Virtual Dataset</em> capabilities within NoSQLBench allow you to generate data on the fly. There are many reasons for using this technique in testing, but it is often a topic that is overlooked or taken for granted.<p>This has multiple positive effects on the fidelity of a test:<ul><li>It is very much more efficient than interacting with storage systems and piping data around. In most cases, even loading data from lightweight storage like NVMe will be more time intensive than simply generating it.<li>As such, it leaves significant headroom on the table for introducing other valuable capabilities into the test system, like advanced rate metering, coordinated omission awareness, and more.<li>Changing the generated data is as easy as changing the recipe.<li>The efficiency of the client is often high enough to support single-client test setups without appreciable loss of capacity.<li>Because of modern procedural generation techniques, the variety and shape of data available is significant. Increasing the space of possibilities is a matter of adding new algorithms. There is no data bulk to manage.<li>Sophisticated test setups that are highly data dependent are portable. All you need is the test client. The building blocks for data generation are included, and many pre-built testing scenarios are already wired to use them.<li>It is straight-forward to design incremental data generation schemes which produce monotonic identifiers, pseudo-random traversal over the values, or even statistically-shaped versions of incremental or pseudo-random values.</ul><p>Additional details of this approach are explained below.<h5 id=industrial-strength>Industrial Strength</h5><p>The algorithms used to generate data are based on advanced techniques in the realm of variate sampling. The authors have gone to great lengths to ensure that data generation is efficient and as much O(1) in processing time as possible.<p>For example, one technique that is used to achieve this is to initialize and cache data in high resolution look-up tables for distributions which may otherwise perform differently depending on their respective density functions. The existing Apache Commons Math libraries have been adapted into a set of interpolated Inverse Cumulative Distribution sampling functions. This means that you can use them all in the same place as you would a Uniform distribution, and once initialized, they sample with identical overhead. This means that by changing your test definition, you don’t accidentally change the behavior of your test client; only the data, as intended.<h5 id=a-purpose-built-tool>A Purpose-Built Tool</h5><p>Many other testing systems avoid building a dataset generation component. It’s a tough problem to solve, so it’s often just avoided. Instead, they use libraries like “faker” or other sources of data which weren’t designed for testing at scale. Faker is well named, no pun intended. It was meant as a vignette and wire-framing library, not a source of test data for realistic results. If you are using a testing tool for scale testing and relying on a faker variant, then you will almost certainly get invalid results that do not represent how a system would perform in production.<p>The virtual dataset component of NoSQLBench is a library that was designed for high scale and realistic data streams. It uses the limits of the data types in the JVM to simulate high cardinality datasets which approximate production data distributions for realistic and reproducible results.<h5 id=deterministic>Deterministic</h5><p>The data that is generated by the virtual dataset libraries is deterministic. This means that for a given cycle in a test, the operation that is synthesized for that cycle will be the same from one session to the next. This is intentional. If you want to perturb the test data from one session to the next, then you can most easily do it by simply selecting a different set of cycles as your basis.<p>This means that if you find something interesting in a test run, you can go back to it just by specifying the cycles in question. It also means that you aren’t losing comparative value between tests with additional randomness thrown in. The data you generate will still look random to the human eye, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t be reproducible.<h5 id=statistically-shaped>Statistically Shaped</h5><p>If you want a normal distribution, you can have it simply by specifying <code>Normal(50,10)</code>. The values drawn from this sampling function are deterministic <em>AND</em> normal. If you want another distribution, you can have it. All the distributions provided by the Apache Commons math libraries are supported. You can ask for a stream of floating point values 1 trillion values long, in any order. You can use discrete or continuous distributions, with whatever distribution parameters you need.<h5 id=best-of-both-worlds>Best of Both Worlds</h5><p>Some might worry that fully synthetic testing data is not realistic enough. The devil is in the details on these arguments, but suffice it to say that you can pick the level of real data you use as seed data with NoSQLBench. You don’t have to choose between realism and agility. The procedural data generation approach allows you to have all the benefits of testing agility of low-entropy testing tools while retaining nearly all the benefits of real testing data.<p>For example, using the alias sampling method and a published US census (public domain) list of names and surnames tha occurred more than 100x, we can provide extremely accurate samples of names according to the published labels and weights. The alias method allows us to sample accurately in <em>O(1)</em> time from the entire dataset by turning a large number of weights into two uniform samples. You will simply not find a better way to sample realistic (US) names than this. (If you do, please file an issue!) Actually, any data set that you have in CSV form with a weight column can also be used this way, so you’re not strictly limited to US census data.<h5 id=java-idiomatic-extension>Java Idiomatic Extension</h5><p>The way that the virtual dataset component works allows Java developers to write any extension to the data generation functions simply in the form of Java functional interfaces. As long as they include the annotation processor and annotate their classes, they will show up in the runtime and be available to any workload by their class name.<p>Additionally, annotation based examples and annotation processing is used to hoist function docs directly into the published docs that go along with any version of NoSQLBench.<h5 id=binding-recipes>Binding Recipes</h5><p>It is possible to stitch data generation functions together directly in a workload YAML. These are data-flow sketches of functions that can be copied and pasted between workload descriptions to share or remix data streams. This allows for the adventurous to build sophisticated virtual datasets that emulate nuances of real datasets, but in a form that takes up less space on the screen than this paragraph!<h2 id=portable-workloads>Portable Workloads</h2><p>All the workloads that you can build with NoSQLBench are self-contained in a workload file. This is a statement-oriented configuration file that contains templates for the operations you want to run in a workload.<p>This defines part of an activity—the iterative flywheel part that is run directly within an activity type. This file contains everything needed to run a basic activity: a set of statements in some ratio. It can be used to start an activity, or as part of several activities within a scenario.<h3 id=standard-yaml-format>Standard YAML Format</h3><p>The format for describing statements in NoSQLBench is generic, but in a particular way that is specialized around describing statements for a workload. That means that you can use the same YAML format to describe a workload for kafka as you can for Apache Cassandra or DSE.<p>The YAML structure has been tailored to describing statements, their data generation bindings, how they are grouped and selected, and the parameters needed by drivers, such as whether they should be prepared statements or not.<p>Furthermore, the YAML format allows for defaults and overrides with a very simple mechanism that reduces editing fatigue for frequent users.<p>You can also templatize document-wide macro parameters which are taken from the command line just like any other parameter. This is a way of templating a workload and making it multipurpose or adjustable on the fly.<h3 id=experimentation-friendly>Experimentation Friendly</h3><p>Because the workload YAML format is generic across driver types, it is possible to ask one driver type to interpret the statements that are meant for another. This isn’t generally a good idea, but it becomes extremely handy when you want to have a high level driver type like <code>stdout</code> interpret the syntax of another driver like <code>cql</code>. When you do this, the stdout activity type _ plays_ the statements to your console as they would be executed in CQL, data bindings and all.<p>This means you can empirically and directly demonstrate and verify access patterns, data skew, and other dataset details before you change back to cql mode and turn up the settings for a higher scale test. It takes away the guess work about what your test is actually doing, and it works for all drivers.<h2 id=scripting-environment>Scripting Environment</h2><p>The ability to write open-ended testing simulations is provided in NoSQLBench by means of a scripted runtime, where each scenario is driven from a control script that can do anything the user wants.<h5 id=dynamic-parameters>Dynamic Parameters</h5><p>Some configuration parameters of activities are designed to be assignable while a workload is running. This makes things like threads, rates, and other workload dynamics in real-time. The internal APIs work with the scripting environment to expose these parameters directly to scenario scripts. Drivers that are provided to NoSQLBench can also expose dynamic parameters in the same way so that anything can be scripted dynamically when needed.<h5 id=scripting-automatons>Scripting Automatons</h5><p>When a NoSQLBench scenario is running, it is under the control of a single-threaded script. Each activity that is started by this script is run within its own thread pool, simultaneously and asynchronously.<p>The control script has executive control of the activities, as well as full visibility into the metrics that are provided by each activity. The way these two parts of the runtime meet is through the service objects which are installed into the scripting runtime. These service objects provide a named access point for each running activity and its metrics.<p>This means that the scenario script can do something simple, like start activities and wait for them to complete, OR, it can do something more sophisticated like dynamically and iteratively scrutinize the metrics and make real-time adjustments to the workload while it runs.<h5 id=analysis-methods>Analysis Methods</h5><p>Scripting automatons that do feedback-oriented analysis of a target system are called analysis methods in NoSQLBench. These are used for advanced testing scenarios. Advanced testers or researchers can build their own in a way that interacts with a live system with feedback and sampling times measured in seconds.<h5 id=command-line-scripting>Command Line Scripting</h5><p>The command line has the form of basic test commands and parameters. These command get converted directly into scenario control script in the order they appear. The user can choose whether to stay in high level executive mode, with simple commands like <code>nb5 test-scenario ...</code>, or to drop directly into script design. They can look at the equivalent script for any command line by running <code>--show-script</code>. If you take the script that is dumped to console and run it, it will do exactly the same thing as if you hadn’t even looked at it and just ran basic commands on the command line.<p>There are even ways to combine script fragments, full commands, and calls to scripts on the command line. Since each variant is merely a way of constructing scenario script, they all get composited together before the scenario script is run.<p>New introductions to NoSQLBench should focus on the command line. Once a user is familiar with this, it is up to them whether to tap into the deeper functionality. If they don’t need to know about scenario scripting, then they shouldn’t have to learn about it to be effective. This is what we are calling a <em>scalable user experience</em>.<h5 id=compared-to-dsls>Compared to DSLs</h5><p>Other tools may claim that their DSL makes scenario “simulation” easier. In practice, any DSL is generally dependent on a development tool to lay the language out in front of a user in a fluent way. This means that DSLs are almost always developer-targeted tools, and mostly useless for casual users who don’t want to break out an IDE.<p>One of the things a DSL proponent may tell you is that it tells you “all the things you can do!”. This is de-facto the same thing as it telling you “all the things you can’t do” because it’s not part of the DSL. This is not a win-win for the user. For DSL-based systems, the user is required to use the DSL, even when it interferes with the user’s creative control. Most DSLs aren’t rich enough to do much that is interesting from a simulation perspective.<p>In NoSQLBench, we don’t force the user to use the programming abstractions except at a very surface level: the CLI. It is up to the user whether to open the secret access panel for the more advanced functionality. If they decide to do this, we give them a commodity language (ECMAScript), and we wire it into all the things they were already using. We don’t take away their creative freedom by telling them what they can’t do. This way, users can pick their level of investment and reward as best fits their individual needs, as it should be.<h5 id=scripting-extensions>Scripting Extensions</h5><p>Also mentioned under the section on modularity, it is relatively easy for a developer to add their own scripting extensions into NoSQLBench in the form of named service objects.<h2 id=modular-architecture>Modular Architecture</h2><p>The internal architecture of NoSQLBench is modular throughout. Everything from the scripting extensions to data generation is enumerated at compile time into a service descriptor, and then discovered at runtime by the SPI mechanism in Java.<p>This means that extending and customizing bundles and features is quite manageable.<p>It also means that it is relatively easy to provide a suitable API for multi-protocol support. In fact, there are several drivers available in the current NoSQLBench distribution. You can list them out with <code>nb5 --list-drivers</code>, and you can get help on how to use each of them with <code>nb5 help &LTdriver name></code>.<p>This also is a way for us to encourage and empower other contributors to help develop the capabilities and reach of NoSQLBench. By encouraging others to help us build NoSQLBench modules and extensions, we can help more users in the NoSQL community at large.<h2 id=high-fidelity-metrics>High Fidelity Metrics</h2><p>Since NoSQLBench has been built as a serious testing tool for all users, some attention was necessary on the way metric are used. More details follow…<h5 id=discrete-reservoirs>Discrete Reservoirs</h5><p>In NoSQLBench, we avoid the use of time-decaying metrics reservoirs. Internally, we use HDR reservoirs with discrete time boundaries. This is so that you can look at the min and max values and know that they apply accurately to the whole sampling window.<h5 id=metric-naming>Metric Naming</h5><p>All running activities have a symbolic alias that identifies them for the purposes of automation and metrics. If you have multiple activities running concurrently, they will have different names and will be represented distinctly in the metrics flow.<h5 id=precision-and-units>Precision and Units</h5><p>By default, the internal HDR histogram reservoirs are kept at 4 digits of precision. All timers are kept at nanosecond resolution.<h5 id=metrics-reporting>Metrics Reporting</h5><p>Metrics can be reported via graphite as well as CSV, logs, HDR logs, and HDR stats summary CSV files.<h5 id=coordinated-omission>Coordinated Omission</h5><p>The metrics naming and semantics in NoSQLBench are set up so that you can have coordinated omission metrics when they are appropriate, but there are no there changes when they are not. This means that the metric names and meanings remain stable in any case.<p>Particularly, NoSQLBench tries to avoid the term “latency” altogether as it is often overused and thus prone to confusing people.<p>Instead, the terms <code>service time</code>, <code>wait time</code>, and <code>response time</code> are used. These are abbreviated in metrics as <code>servicetime</code>, <code>waittime</code>, and <code>responsetime</code>.<p>The <code>servicetime</code> metric is the only one which is always present. When a rate limiter is used, then additionally <code>waittime</code> and <code>responsetime</code> are reported.<h2 id=advanced-testing-features>Advanced Testing Features</h2><p>👉 Some features discussed here are only for advanced testing scenarios. First-time users should become familiar with the basic options first.<h5 id=hybrid-rate-limiting>Hybrid Rate Limiting</h5><p>Rate limiting is a complicated endeavor, if you want to do it well. The basic rub is that going fast means you have to be less accurate, and vice-versa. As such, rate limiting is a parasitic drain on any system. The act of rate limiting itself poses a limit to the maximum rate, regardless of the settings you pick. This occurs as a side effect of forcing your system to interact with some hardware notion of time passing, which takes CPU cycles that could be going to the thing you are limiting.<p>This means that in practice, rate limiters are often very featureless. It’s daunting enough to need rate limiting, and asking for anything more than that is often wishful thinking. Not so in NoSQLBench.<p>The rate limiter in NoSQLBench provides a comparable degree of performance and accuracy to others found in the Java ecosystem, but it <em>also</em> has advanced features:<ul><li>It allows a sliding scale between average rate limiting and strict rate limiting, called _ bursting_.<li>It internally accumulates delay time, for C.O. friendly metrics which are separately tracked for each and every operation.<li>It is resettable and reconfigurable on the fly, including the bursting rate.<li>It provides its configured values in addition to performance data in metrics, capturing your rate limiter settings as a simple matter of metrics collection.<li>It comes with advanced scripting helpers which allow you to read data directly from histogram reservoirs, or control the reservoir window programmatically.</ul><h5 id=flexible-error-handling>Flexible Error Handling</h5><p>An emergent facility in NoSQLBench is the way that error are handled within an activity. For example, with the CQL activity type, you are able to route error handling for any of the known exception types. You can count errors, you can log them. You can cause errored operations to auto-retry if possible, up to a configurable number of tries.<p>This means, that as a user, you get to decide what your test is about. Is it about measuring some nominal but anticipated level of errors due to intentional over-saturation? If so, then count the errors, and look at their histogram data for timing details within the available timeout.<p>Are you doing a basic stability test, where you want the test to error out for even the slightest error? You can configure for that if you need.<h5 id=cycle-logging>Cycle Logging</h5><p>It is possible to record the result status of each and every cycle in a NoSQLBench test run. If the results are mostly homogeneous, the RLE encoding of the results will reduce the output file down to a small fraction of the number of cycles. The errors are mapped to ordinals by error type, and these ordinals are stored into a direct RLE-encoded log file. For most testing where most of the results are simply success, this file will be tiny. You can also convert the cycle log into textual form for other testing and post-processing and vice-versa.<h5 id=op-sequencing>Op Sequencing</h5><p>The way that operations are planned for execution in NoSQLBench is based on a stable ordering that is configurable. The statement forms are mixed together based on their relative ratios. The three schemes currently supported are round-robin with exhaustion (bucket), duplicate in order (concat), and a way to spread each statement out over the unit interval (interval). These account for most configuration scenarios without users having to micromanage their statement templates.</article></main><footer><div class=c><nav class=tpad><div></div></nav><p>© <span id=year>2025</span> NoSQLBench Documentation<p>Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a> & <a href=https://github.com/jieiku/abridge/ target=_blank>Abridge</a></div></footer><span class=topout> <span class=topleft> </span><a title="Back to Top" class=top href=#><i class="svgs svgh angu"></i></a> </span>
