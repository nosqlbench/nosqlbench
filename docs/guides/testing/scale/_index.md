# Testing at Scale

Testing distributed systems at scale requires careful consideration of:

- **Determinism** - Ensuring reproducible tests
- **Client Sizing** - Avoiding bottlenecks in your test infrastructure
- **Scaling Math** - Understanding the mathematics of distributed load
- **Vantage Points** - Testing from appropriate locations

This section provides practical guidance for scaling your performance tests effectively while maintaining accuracy and reproducibility.
