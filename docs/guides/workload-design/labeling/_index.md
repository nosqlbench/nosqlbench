# Labeling System

NoSQLBench provides a comprehensive labeling system for organizing metrics, annotations, and test results. Labels ensure your testing data is:

- **Traceable** - Find specific test runs months later
- **Identifiable** - Distinguish between different test scenarios
- **Contextual** - Understand the conditions of each test
- **Self-consistent** - Maintain coherent metadata across all components

This section covers:

- Understanding the labeling system and automatic labels
- Filtering and validating labels
- Best practices for labeling standards

Proper labeling transforms chaotic test data into organized, queryable knowledge. Master these techniques to make your testing results truly valuable over time.
