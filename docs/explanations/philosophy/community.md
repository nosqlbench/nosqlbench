In general, our goals with NoSQLBench are to make the help systems and examples wrap around the
users like a suit of armor, so that they feel capable of doing most things without having to ask for
help. Please keep this in mind when looking for personal support from our community, and help us
find those places where the docs are lacking. Maybe you can help us by adding some missing docs!

## Doc Site

This site is intended to be the first and most useful form of documentation for NoSQLBench. It is
hosted on a separate project repo on GitHub so that it can be owned and maintained by the NoSQLBench
user and developer community.
(Click the GitHub link [[here](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench-docs)] to go directly there.) If you
see something here that should be updated or expanded, please submit an issue, reach out on discord,
or even better, submit a pull request!

## Discord Server

Our discord server is where users and developers can discuss anything about NoSQLBench and support
each other. Please
[[join us](https://discord.gg/dBHRakusMN)] there if you are a new user of NoSQLBench!

## Contributing

We welcome all builders to NoSQLBench to help us improve it. Whether you are focused on improving
docs, building a new subsystem or developing a new scripting extension, there is room for everyone, and all are
appreciated. We have a new [contributing](../../development/contributing.md) section
if you are interested.

## Documentation

The primary documentation for NoSQLBench has been moved to this site. While there are still some
comment line help facilities, like `nb5 help <driver>`, this is the best place to read it.
When nb5 is built, it automatically exports all the rendered docs content to this site.

This site contains much more documentation than you will want to browse on the command line.
It is recommended that you look here first with the search function when possible.

## Bug Fixes

If you think you have found a bug, please
[[file a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug)]
. NoSQLBench is actively used within DataStax, and verified bugs will get attention as resources
permit. We appreciate all feedback, no matter how detailed. However, bug reports which are more
detailed, or which include steps to reproduce any issues will get attention first.
