The NoSQLBench project has a few dedicated builders. We would like to diversify the
maintainer base of the project as well as build bridges to new communities in the NoSQL ecosystem.

This is good for the community and the maintainers, and helps foster trust in those that depend
on the project.

If you are looking for an interesting project to work on, we're eager to work with you.
Whether you are a seasoned builder or just starting out, there is a way for us to get you
included into the project that is fun and satisfying for everyone.

Just inquire within if you are interested.
