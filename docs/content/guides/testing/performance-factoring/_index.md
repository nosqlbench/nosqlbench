# Performance Factoring

Performance factoring is the systematic identification and measurement of factors that affect system performance. This section provides:

- **Concepts** - Fundamental terminology and principles
- **Framing** - How to frame performance analysis questions
- **Key Workflows** - Step-by-step testing methodologies
- **Parameter Spaces** - Multi-dimensional performance analysis

These guides transform ad-hoc performance testing into rigorous, repeatable analysis. Learn to:

- Measure saturating vs. nominal throughput
- Account for operational headroom
- Build scaling mathematics
- Automate performance characterization

Master these techniques to produce trustworthy, actionable performance insights.
