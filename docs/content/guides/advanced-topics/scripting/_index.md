# Scenario Scripting

NoSQLBench embeds a powerful JavaScript scripting environment built on GraalVM. This enables:

- **Dynamic Control** - Adjust activities in real-time based on metrics
- **Reactive Testing** - Respond to system behavior automatically
- **Custom Logic** - Build sophisticated multi-phase test scenarios
- **Full Access** - Control all NoSQLBench components programmatically

The scripting layer provides the "control room" while Java activities provide the "engine room." You get both the efficiency of compiled workloads and the flexibility of dynamic scripting.

Browse this section to learn how to harness the full programmable power of NoSQLBench.
