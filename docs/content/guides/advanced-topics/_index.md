# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced NoSQLBench features for power users and sophisticated testing scenarios:

- **Scenario Scripting** - JavaScript-based test automation and control
- **Performance Factoring** - Systematic performance analysis methodologies
- **Testing at Scale** - Distributed testing and scalability patterns
- **Configuration Techniques** - Advanced configuration management

These topics assume familiarity with basic NoSQLBench concepts and workload design. They unlock the full programmable power of the NoSQLBench runtime, enabling reactive testing, automated analysis, and complex multi-phase scenarios.
