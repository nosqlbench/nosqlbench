This section delves deeper than the essential documentation. The goal of this section is to give 
insight into the design thinking and approach for some of the more esoteric-but-essential gears 
and cogs of NoSQLBench.

You might want to read this section if you want to learn as much as possible about NoSQLBench. 
There will still be some things not explained here, but if there are particular topics of 
interest, please [file a request](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=docs). 

👉 If you find anything in this section which you believe should be in the user guide proper, 
please let us know.
