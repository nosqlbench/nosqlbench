In general, our goal with NoSQLBench is to make the help systems and examples wrap around users like
armor, so that you can accomplish most tasks without personal support. When you do need help, please
let us know where the docs are lacking—maybe you can even help us by adding the missing bits!

## Doc Site

This site is the first and most useful form of documentation for NoSQLBench. It lives in the
[nosqlbench-docs](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench-docs) repository so that the community can
own and maintain it. If you see something that should be updated or expanded, please submit an
issue, reach out on Discord, or best of all, open a pull request.

## Discord Server

Our Discord server is where users and developers discuss NoSQLBench and support each other. Please
[join us](https://discord.gg/dBHRakusMN) if you are new to the project.

## Contributing

We welcome all builders to help improve NoSQLBench. Whether you are focused on docs, building a new
subsystem, or developing a new scripting extension, there is room for everyone. Read the
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide if you are interested.

## Built-In Docs

NoSQLBench also provides command-line help. You can list built-in topics using `nb5 help topics` and
learn more about any topic with `nb5 help <topic>`. This doc site contains more documentation than
you will want to browse on the command line, so start here when possible.

## Bug Fixes

If you think you have found a bug, please
[file a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug).
NoSQLBench is actively used within DataStax, and verified bugs will get attention as resources
permit. We appreciate all feedback, no matter how detailed, but issues with repro steps get
prioritized.
