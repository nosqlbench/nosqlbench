In general, our goal with NoSQLBench is to make the help systems and examples wrap around users like
armor, so that you feel capable of doing most things without having to ask for help. Please keep
this in mind when looking for personal support from the community, and help us find those places
where the docs are lacking. Maybe you can help us by adding some missing docs!

## Doc Site

This site is intended to be the first and most useful form of documentation for NoSQLBench. It is
hosted on GitHub so that it can be owned and maintained by the NoSQLBench user and developer
community ([see the repo here](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench-docs)). If you see something
that should be updated or expanded, please submit an issue, reach out on Discord, or—even
better—submit a pull request!

## Discord Server

Our Discord server is where users and developers can discuss anything about NoSQLBench and support
one another. Please [join us](https://discord.gg/dBHRakusMN) if you are a new user.

## Contributing

We welcome all builders to NoSQLBench to help us improve it. Whether you are focused on improving
docs, building a new subsystem, or developing a new scripting extension, there is room for everyone
and all are appreciated. Please read about
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested.

## Documentation

The primary documentation for NoSQLBench has been moved to this site. While there are still some
command-line help facilities (like `nb5 help <driver>`), this is the best place to read it. When
`nb5` is built, it automatically exports the rendered docs content to this site.

This site contains much more documentation than you will want to browse on the command line. It is
recommended that you look here first with the search function whenever possible.

## Bug Fixes

If you think you have found a bug, please
[file a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug).
NoSQLBench is actively used within DataStax, and verified bugs will get attention as resources
permit. Detailed bug reports or issues with repro steps will receive attention first.

## Feature Requests

If you would like to see something in NoSQLBench that is not there yet, please
[submit a feature request](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=feature).

## Documentation Requests

If you would like to see a specific NoSQLBench or testing topic added to the guidebook, please
[request docs content](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=docs).
